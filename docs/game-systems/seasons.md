# Seasons

Seasons represent **phases of becoming**, not resets. Your progress persists; only the challenges change.

---

## Season Philosophy

Seasons mark stages in your journey:
1. **Awakening** - Realize you've been asleep
2. **Challenge** - Face internal enemies
3. **Mastery** - Discipline becomes identity

---

## Season Rules

- Stats persist across seasons
- Memory/history persists
- Only challenges and content change
- Seasonal leaderboard resets
- Seasonal XP tracked separately

## The Three Seasons

### Season 1: Awakening
*Theme: FOUNDATION*

> You learn the cost of inaction. The System reveals what neglect has hidden.

**XP Multiplier**: 1.0x

**Focus**:
- Establishing daily habits
- Learning the System interface
- First streak milestones
- Core quest introduction

**Intro Narrative**:
```
SEASON 1: AWAKENING

A dormant capability has been detected.

Physical output: underdeveloped
Recovery capacity: unstable
Discipline coefficient: unknown

This season exists to establish baselines.
To reveal what neglect has hidden.
To make visible what comfort has obscured.

You will not be pushed.
You will simply be measured.
```

---

### Season 2: The Contender
*Theme: CHALLENGE*

> You stop negotiating with yourself. Excuses become visible lies.

**XP Multiplier**: 1.1x

**Focus**:
- Harder dungeons unlocked
- First boss fights available
- Extended streak requirements
- Title progression paths

**Intro Narrative**:
```
SEASON 2: THE CONTENDER

Foundation detected.
Capacity confirmed.

This season exists to test what was built.
To reveal the difference between
what you say and what you do.

Excuses will become visible.
Negotiations will fail.
The System does not bargain.

You will contend with yourself.
Or you will not.
```

---

### Season 3: The Monarch
*Theme: MASTERY*

> You choose when to push — and when not to. Control replaces compulsion.

**XP Multiplier**: 1.2x

**Focus**:
- Hardest content available
- Advanced boss encounters
- Optimization challenges
- Legacy title unlocks

**Intro Narrative**:
```
SEASON 3: THE MONARCH

Compulsion has been replaced.
Discipline is no longer forced.

This season exists for those who
no longer need external structure.
Who choose the hard path
when the easy path is available.

You will not be commanded.
You will command yourself.

The System watches.
It does not rule.
```

---

## Season Transitions

**Trigger**: ~60 days or reaching specific level (whichever first)

**Season 1 → 2**: Level 15 or Day 60
**Season 2 → 3**: Level 25 or Day 120
