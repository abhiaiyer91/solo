# Player Journey Map

This document maps the complete player experience from first login through mastery. It defines when systems unlock, what narrative beats occur, and how the emotional arc progresses.

---

## Journey Philosophy

The player journey follows the **Solo Leveling** progression archetype:

1. **Awakening** - Realize you've been asleep
2. **Foundation** - Build basic habits through repetition
3. **Challenge** - Face the internal enemies that stopped you before
4. **Mastery** - Discipline becomes identity, not effort

The System's role changes throughout:
- Early: **Mirror** (shows you what you are)
- Middle: **Challenger** (tests what you're becoming)
- Late: **Witness** (records what you've become)
